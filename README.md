### Module Filter Content according country for Joomla 3

This module works to filter content according by user region.

It was developed to working in Joomla but you can try to change for wordpress or others projects.

I used IP database from Maxmind (http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) to filter IP user.

To match the tables with IP code country I create in articles custom fields country codes with dpfields(https://joomla.digital-peak.com/products/dpfields).

###How to Install //// Como instalar

1. Download zip file.

2. Upload to joomla.

3. Now you need to create a module to define what category you would like to show in filter.
